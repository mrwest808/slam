## What?
An NBA calendar showing past & upcoming games for your favorite team(s), with
or without scores.

## Why?
As a basketball-loving European early bird, watching NBA games live is not an
option. This calendar gives you a quick overview of upcoming games without
spoiling results of previous games, unless you choose it.

I'm sure there are alternatives to this however, and the *real* reason for
this app is to serve as a test subject :microscope: for testing out different
languages and frameworks.

## Installation
Coming soon...

## Implementations
- [React.js](react-js/)
